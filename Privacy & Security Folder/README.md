## -> HERE WILL BE POSTED IMPORTANT APPS/TOOLS TO USE TO HAVE MAXIMUM SECURITY AND PRIVACY IN YOUR CYBER SESSION ##

- [Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security): Computer security, cybersecurity or 
information technology security is the protection of computer systems 
and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or
 electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the 
services they provide. The field is becoming more important due to 
increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless 
network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of 
"smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various 
devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Owing to its 
complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is 
also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.

- [Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy) : Internet privacy involves the right or
 mandate of personal privacy concerning the storing, repurposing, 
provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to 
oneself via the internet. Internet privacy is a subset of data privacy. 
Privacy concerns have been articulated from the beginnings of 
large-scale computer sharing. Privacy can entail either personally 
identifiable information or non-PII information such as a site visitor's
 behavior on a website. PII refers to any information that can be used 
to identify an individual. For example, age and physical address alone 
could identify who an individual is without explicitly disclosing their 
name, as these two factors are unique enough to identify a specific 
person typically. Other forms of PII may soon include GPS tracking data 
used by apps, as the daily commute and routine information can be enough
 to identify an individual.
 **BOTH OF THEM ARE RIGHTS SO WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS!**
